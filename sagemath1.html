<h1 class="title">Installing SageMath on Ubuntu 18.04 part 1</h1>
<p>
Lately I have decided that I wanted to move away from Wolfram Mathematica tool set, although part of my present research rely on it. I was feeling that there was not many positive aspects to it when compared to competitors like Maple and SageMath, other than the fact that I can get it quite cheaply at the moment.
That will certainly change in the future, so I decided to plan and move away from this tooling and migrate to a more open envorinment. That was why I decided to go with SageMath.
</p>

<p>
Motivations aside, what really triggered me was the fact I wanted to set up a org file in Emacs with most of my work including numerics and symbolic calculations and export it to pdf or html^<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>. Orgmode really hits the nail at this one but it was really saddening to see the state of ob-mathematica^<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>, I had a really bad time with it although I did get to work with Jupyter Notebooks. One of the most positive aspects of SageMath was the fact that both <a href="https://github.com/sagemath/sage-shell-mode">sage-shell-mode</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sagemath/ob-sagemath">ob-sage</a> exist, I was pretty excited to start working on getting started on it.
</p>

<p>
Now for the installation. This version of Ubuntu was really odd to install SageMath at, I went looking for places to start and readily found their <a href="https://www.sagemath.org/">website</a> and <a href="https://www.sagemath.org/download-linux.html">binaries for linux</a>.
After downloading I installed in the usual way, by first unpacking the tarball
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">tar -xvjf sage-9.0-Ubuntu_18.04-x86_64.tar.bz2
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Then executing with 
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">./sage
</pre>
</div>

<p>
But unfortunetely I had problems permission problems installing this way. I thought then that I had been lucky to find this <a href="https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=987954">tutorial</a>, following it though and making sure to replace the deprecated command 
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">gksu gedit /usr/local/bin/sage
</pre>
</div>

<p>
with 
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">gedit admin:///usr/local/bin/sage
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Resulted in same as above. Then finally I head to the good &amp; old package manager
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">sudo apt install sagemath
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Still no joy. Will I be able to install SageMath to replace Mathematica in anytime soon? Let us hope so.
